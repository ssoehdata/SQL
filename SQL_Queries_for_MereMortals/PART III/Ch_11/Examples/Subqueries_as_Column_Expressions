 -- Subqueries as Columnn Expressions 

SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, Orders.OrderDate,
    Orders.ShipDate,
    (SELECT Customers.CustLastName
    FROM Customers 
    WHERE Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID) 
FROM Orders 
WHERE Orders.ShipDate = '2017-10-03'
;



-- this could be solved with an Inner Join (below) and the subquery example is intended to demonstrate the concept: 

SELECT Orders.OrderNumber, Orders.OrderDate, Orders.ShipDate, Customers.CustLastName
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.ShipDate = '2017-10-03'
;

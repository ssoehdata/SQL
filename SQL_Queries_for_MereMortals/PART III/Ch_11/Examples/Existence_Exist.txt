--  Notes: Both set membership  (IN) and quantified (SOME, ANY, ALL) predicates perform 
-- a comparison with a value expression- usually a column from the source specified in the 
-- FROM clause of the outer query.  Sometimes it is useful to know that related row 
-- EXISTS in the result set returned by a subquery. (this example is based on a problem 
-- in chapter 8 using complex AND and INNER JOINs.
